dataframe
=========

A fast, safe, and intuitive DataFrame library for Haskell.

**dataframe** brings the power of type-safe, functional data manipulation to your analytics workflow. Built on Haskell's strong type system, it catches errors at compile time while delivering the performance and expressiveness you need for real-world data analysis.

*******************************
Why use this DataFrame library?
*******************************

**Type Safety Meets Data Analysis**

* **Catch bugs before runtime**: Statically typed expressions makes code easier to reason about and catches many bugs at compile time—before your code ever runs.
* **Expressive and composable**: Encourages concise, declarative, and composable data pipelines that read like the logic you're thinking.
* **Performance without compromise**: Delivers high performance thanks to Haskell's optimizing compiler and efficient memory model.

**Designed for Productivity**

* **Interactive-first design**: Expressive syntax, helpful error messages, and sensible defaults make exploration a joy.
* **Works everywhere**: Works seamlessly in both command-line and notebook environments—great for exploration and scripting alike.
* **Familiar operations**: If you've used pandas, dplyr, or polars, you'll feel right at home.

****************
Who is this for?
****************

* **Data scientists and analysts** who want type safety with minimal cognitive/code overhead.
* **Haskell developers** building data/machine learning pipelines or analytics applications
