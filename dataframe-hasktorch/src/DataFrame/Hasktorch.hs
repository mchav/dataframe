{- | Converts a dataframe to a floating-point tensor.

This function converts all columns in the dataframe to floats and creates
a tensor suitable for machine learning operations. The tensor dimensions
are determined by the dataframe's shape.

==== __Dimensional behavior__

* Multi-column dataframe: Creates a 2D tensor with shape @[rows, columns]@
* Single-column dataframe: Creates a 1D tensor with shape @[rows]@

==== __Conversion process__

1. Converts the dataframe to a float matrix using 'D.toFloatMatrix'
2. Flattens the matrix features into a 1D representation
3. Reshapes into the appropriate tensor dimensions

==== __Throws__

* 'DataFrameException' - if any column cannot be converted to float

==== __Examples__

>>> toTensor df  -- where df has shape (100, 5)
Tensor with shape [100, 5]

>>> toTensor df  -- where df has shape (100, 1)
Tensor with shape [100]

==== __See also__

* 'toIntTensor' - for integer tensor conversion

{- | Converts a dataframe to an integer tensor.

This function converts all columns in the dataframe to integers and creates
a tensor suitable for machine learning operations (e.g., classification labels,
discrete features). The tensor dimensions are determined by the dataframe's shape.

==== __Dimensional behavior__

* Multi-column dataframe: Creates a 2D tensor with shape @[rows, columns]@
* Single-column dataframe: Creates a 1D tensor with shape @[rows]@

==== __Conversion process__

1. Converts the dataframe to an int matrix using 'D.toIntMatrix'
2. Flattens the matrix features into a 1D representation
3. Reshapes into the appropriate tensor dimensions

==== __Throws__

* 'DataFrameException' - if any column cannot be converted to int

==== __Examples__

>>> toIntTensor labelsDf  -- where labelsDf has shape (100, 1)
Tensor with shape [100]

>>> toIntTensor featuresDf  -- where featuresDf has shape (100, 3)
Tensor with shape [100, 3]

==== __Note__

Floating-point values in the dataframe will be rounded to the nearest integer.
See 'D.toIntMatrix' for details on the conversion behavior.
